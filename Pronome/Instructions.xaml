                ProNome is a tool for all musicians that lets you create multiple layers 
                of looping rhythmic patterns. Use it for practicing and learning rhythm on 
                any instrument, or as a means to explore and discover new rhythmic patterns, or 
                as a fully programmable drum machine!

            <Paragraph Style="{StaticResource headerStyle}">Creating a Beat</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                In ProNome, a 'beat' or 'groove' refers to a group of distinct rhythmic 
                patterns called 'beat layers.' To create the rhythm of a beat layer, enter 
                one or more values seperated by commas into that layer's 'Beat' input. 
                These values are called the 'beat cells.' ProNome uses a numeric rhythmic 
                notation in which '1' represents a quarter-note time value. Using some 
                basic math, you can determine the numeric value of any rhythmic unit 
                based upon it's relationship to the quarter-note pulse.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                If you enter '1,' you will get a loop containing a single quarter-note.
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">2,.5,1</Span> will give you a half-note followed by an eighth-note then a 
                quarter-note. A half-note is two quarter-notes, therefore if a quarter 
                note is 1 then a half-note equals 2. An eighth-note is one half of a 
                quarter-note, so by dividing 1 by 2 we get '.5'.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                The beat layers can have as many cells as you want. By making a beat 
                layer longer or shorter than another beat layer, you can create what's 
                known as a cross-rhythm or hemiola.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                In addition to simple values, you can also enter mathmatical expressions 
                using the +, -, *, and / operators.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1/4,1/3+1</Span> will give you a 16th-note then a triplet 8th-note tied to a 
                quarter-note.
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">.5*4,3/2-1/3</Span> will give you four eighth-notes that are 
                tied together (equal to one half-note) and then a dotted quarter-note 
                with an eighth-note triplet subtracted out.
                <LineBreak/>
                <Span Style="{StaticResource noteStyle}">
                    Note: Expressions are evaluated using the standard order of operations, except 
                    that parenthesis are not used for grouping or multiplying terms. You can 
                    use '*' or 'x' as the multiplication operator.

                When you're using ProNome's editor, you won't need to know the subtleties 
                of beat code syntax because the editor will be generating the code for you.
                 Thus, understanding the basics outlined above is all you really need to know to 
                start making beats.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                There's several notation shortcuts for entering beats that have 
                repeating cells. When entering a beat containing a cell that is 
                repeated consecutively such as
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1,1,1,1,1,.5</Span>, you can use the '(x)' 
                modifier, where x is the number of times to repeat. For example,
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1,1,1,1,1,.5</Span> can be 
                rewritten as
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1(5),.5</Span>. If you want to repeat 
                a cell but then add or subtract a value from the last copy, you 
                can put in an expression after the closing parentheses. For 
                instance,
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1+1/2(12)+.25,1/3(5)-1/4</Span> will give you 12 dotted 
                quarter-notes with a sixteenth-note added on to the 12th dotted 
                quarter, and then 5 triplet eighth-notes with the 5th one being 
                a triplet eighth-note minus a sixteenth-note (not a very musical example!).
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                To have more than one beat cell repeated, we can use the square 
                bracket group repeat: '[x1, x2, x3...]n' where the x's are cells 
                to be repeated and n is the number of times to repeat. For 
                example, if you want to have a beat that consists of this 
                rhythm:
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1,.5,1,1,.5</Span> played 4 times, followed by this rhythm:
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">.5,.5,1</Span>, you could write it like this:
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">[1,.5,1(2),.5]4,.5(2),1</Span> 
                (note the single cell repeats used in addition to the group repeat). 
                Like with the single cell repeat, the group repeat can modify 
                the last cell of the last repeat using this syntax: 
                [x1, x2, x3...](n)+/-value. Note that n is enclosed in parenthesis 
                and is followed by the expression that modifies the final 
                cell of the last repeat. For example,
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">[1,2,3](2)+.75</Span> is 
                equivalent to
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1,2,3,1,2,3.75</Span>.
                <LineBreak/>
                <Span Style="{StaticResource noteStyle}">Note: You can have multi-cell repeats nested inside other multi-cell repeats.</Span>
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                One last thing to know about multi-cell repeats: you can 
                have the repeat 'exit' after a specific cell on the last 
                time through. To create the exit point, use the '|' character 
                instead of a comma at the point you want to exit. For example,
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">[1,2,3|4](2)+.5,1</Span> is equivalent to
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1,2,3,4,1,2,3.5,1</Span>. Note that 
                the final repeat modifier (in this case, the '+.5') is applied 
                to the cell right before the exit point (in this case, the '3').
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                There's also a shortcut for creating rythmic modulations 
                within a beat layer. A rhythmic modulation occurs when the 
                value of the basic pulse (typically a quarter-note) shifts 
                to a different but related value (such as a dotted 
                quarter-note or a quarter-note triplet) thus implying 
                a different tempo although the tempo hasn't actually 
                changed. Creating a modulation in ProNome is easy: 
                encase the beat cells that you want to modulate in 
                curly brackets then enter the value of the pulse you 
                want to modulate to. Heres a simple example:
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1,.5(2),1,{1,.5(2),1}1/3</Span> the beat cell values outside 
                of the curly brackets are the same as those in the 
                bracketed group: a quarter-note, two eighth-notes, 
                and a quarter-note. The difference is that the time 
                values of the cells within the braces are based on 
                something other than a quarter-note, in this case 
                an eighth-note triplet (1/3), meaning that a '1' 
                within the braces will represent an eigth-note 
                triplet and '.5' represents a sixteenth-note 
                triplet. Another way of explaining it is that 
                within the braces, each beat cell's value will be 
                multiplied by the value of the number or expression 
                to the right of the closing brace.
                <LineBreak/>
                Rythmic modulation braces can be used in conjunction 
                with single cell repeat and group repeat notation. If 
                the repeat has a last cell modifying expression and 
                it is written within the curly brackets, it too will 
                be multiplied by the modulation value.
                <LineBreak/>
                <Span Style="{StaticResource noteStyle}">
                    Note: You can have have nested modulation groups, 
                    meaning that cells occuring inside more than one modulation 
                    will be multiplied by each of those groups' modulation value.

                If your making a complex beat by hand, it's a good idea to insert 
                some comments explaining what's happening so that if you 
                need to make some changes later on its much easier to do. 
                Useful comments could be measure numbers, song form 
                markings, tempo markings (since tempos are not saved 
                between sessions), or anything else that will help your 
                beat code be more than just a giant string of numbers. 
                You can create a comment by using exclamation points like 
                this:
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1(3),!your comment here!.5</Span>. Basically, anything you 
                put between two exclamation points will not effect the beat itself.

                The editor is a powerful and easy to use tool for creating beats 
                in a graphical interface that does most of the number work for you. 
                To get started, click the 'Editor' button at the bottom of the main window.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                The main area of the editor shows each layer as a rectangular row with tick marks 
                representing the cells. Select a cell by left clicking on it or by holding down 
                right click and dragging to make a selection box. You can add to a selection 
                by shift clicking on a cell outside the current selection. This will add that cell 
                and all the cells in-between to the selection. You can only have adjacent cells 
                selected.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                Once you have made a cell selection, a grid is projected onto the layer. Click on any of 
                these grid lines to create a new cell at that position. The grid's spacing is set 
                by the 'Increment' input field, which takes a value such as '1' for quarter-notes or 
                '2/3' for quarter note triplets. There's also a row of buttons with preset rhythmic 
                durations for quickly setting the increment value.

            <Paragraph>
                There is also a 'Measure Size' field that sets the distance between the vertical lines in the

            <Paragraph>
                The sound that is applied to each beat cell is refered to as it's sound source. You set the 
                sound source for a layer using it's 'Source' dropdown selector.
                <LineBreak/>
                There are three types of sound sources:

                        The pitch source allows you to assign a specific pitch or frequency to use for 
                        the default 'beep' sound. When Pitch is selected, the 'Note' field will allow you 
                        to specify the pitch. You can use either standard note names, such as "A4", "c#5", 
                        "Gb3", etc, where the number following the note name is the octave. Alternatively, You  
                        can enter a frequency in hertz, such as '440'.

                        ProNome has an array of high quality drum samples built in. They are organized by 
                        instrument, articulation, and velocity where instrument is the type of drum or 
                        cymbal, articulation is the method by which it is played, and velocity is the force 
                        with which it is struck. For example, "Ride Center V2" is the ride cymbal played 
                        in the center region with a relative velocity of 2. You can quickly find the sound 
                        you want using the source selector's filter field.

                        The silent source is, predictably, silent. It's most useful when applied to the first 
                        cell of a layer - more on this later.

                To assign a sound source to a specific cell, use the '@' symbol followed by either a note 
                symbol or the index number of a drum sample (this is the number to the left of the sample 
                in the source selector drop-down). For example,
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1@Ab5</Span> assigns the 'Ab5' sound source to 
                that cell, regardless of the layer's overall sound source. To make a cell silent, use
                <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">1@0</Span>. Note that the '@' has to come right 
                after the cell's value expression, it can't be placed after any repeat syntax, or used with a 
                reference cell.

                If you're using the editor, you can assign sound sources by selecting cell(s) 
                and changing the source or note fields.

                        the layer waiting for the specified interval before it starts playing, it will then be 
                        offset from the other layers. A similiar effect is accomplished by assigning the 'Silent' 
                        sound source to the first cell of the layer.

                To aid with understanding rhythmic relationships, ProNome offers two different types of 
                visualizers. They are accessed from the main window by clicking the 'Graph' or 'Bounce'

                        The graph presents the beat mapped onto a clock face of sorts, where one trip around 
                        the dial is a full cycle of the beat. A complete cycle of the beat is the amount of 
                        time before it repeats. This can also be expressed as the least-common denominator of 
                        the length of each of the layers. Each beat cell is represented by a tick mark on the 
                        face of the dial, which is broken up into colored rings for each layer.

                        When a beat cell gets played, portion of the graph for it's layer lights up briefly. 
                        This behaviour can be turned off in the options menu.

                        The bounce visualizer has two components: bouncing balls and a conveyor belt like 
                        queue. Each layer is represented with a ball that bounces each time a beat cell is 
                        played, and moving lines to show the upcoming beat cells.
                        <LineBreak/>
                        In the visualizer section of the options menu you can control where the screen is divided 
                        between the balls and the queue and also the amount of taper between the bottom and top 
                        of the queue. You can use these two settings to create a variety of perspective effects.
                        <LineBreak/>

                The Options menu is where many additional features and configurable options are located. 
                Access the options menu by clicking the 'Options' button at the bottom of the main window. 
                The options are divided into the following sections:

                        <LineBreak/>
                        When random muting is enabled, there is a percent chance that a given beat cell will 
                        not be played. You must enter the percent value (0-100) and can optionally supply a 
                        'Ramp Duration' which is the number seconds overwhich the muting percent starts at 0 
                        and ramps up to the full value.

                        <LineBreak/>
                        With intervallic muting, the beat will play for a set duration and then be silent for 
                        a set duration. The 'Audible Interval' field takes a value expression such as
                        <Span Style="{StaticResource codeSample}">4*2</Span> that is time the beat will be audible. 
                        the 'Silent Interval' is the value for how long the beat will be silent.

                        You can save a beat and load previously saved beats from this section. Saved beats 
                        have the file extension '.beat'.

                                Choose 'Export Wav File' to bring up a dialog where you can specify a length 
                                of time in seconds that you want to export. There's also an option to use 
                                the length of the beat's cycle instead to create a loopable audio file.

                                Choose 'Record to Wav File' to start playing the beat while simultaneously 
                                recording to disk. This enables you to change settings such as tempo, volume, and 
                                panning while recording. Stop the playback to end the recording.
